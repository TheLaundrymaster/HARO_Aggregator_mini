Mini HARO Agreggator

A project I worked on while working for Venture PR. 
For this version specifically I shrunk down the original for users whose monitor may not be able to view the original.


The goal of the project was to help the PR agents be able to not be overwelmed with looking through emails about potential clients. Recieveing a large email filled requests three times a day. One in the early morning, evening, and night. The aggregator links up with their work email to grab the HARO (Help a Reporter Out) emails and allow a more specific keyword search to take place. The result is a text file which appears and shows the requests which have the keyword involved. 

The user is able to update the list which goes though and grabs the latest three HARO emails. The resultant data grabbed is placed within another text document which the searcher then uses to look for results. 

Coded within python while also using Google's Gmail API.
Has a Gui to make the process easier to understand.

By clicking on the executable file the program opens.
